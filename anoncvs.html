<h1>Anonymous CVS Access</h1>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="3">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The most recent versions of eCos and RedBoot may be obtained using anonymous CVS access.
This facility provides immediate access to the <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/ecos/packages/NEWS?content-type=text/plain&amp;cvsroot=ecos">latest eCos and RedBoot
features</a> and the rapid deployment of any necessary bug fixes.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with CVS, the following resources may be of use:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/" target="_top">CVShome.org</a> has CVS
    clients available for download. Other information and links to books
    on the subject can also be found at this site.
  </li>
  <li>
    A good starting point is the
    <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html" target="_top">
    Introduction to CVS</a> by Jim Blandy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The CVS sources come with <i>texinfo</i> documentation which is also
    available in <a href="http://www.loria.fr/%7Emolli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html" target="_top"> HTML format</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
We also provide a simple but effective way to
<a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=ecos">view the CVS repository</a>
over the web using CVSweb. You can inspect the contents, history and
differences between versions of all files in the repository in this way.<p></p>

<h2>eCos 2.0</h2>

<p>The eCos v2.0 code base is now available via
anonymous CVS. eCos v2.0 includes a change to the licence from
the old Red Hat eCos Public Licence (RHEPL) to the GNU General Public License (GPL)
with a modification that makes it more suitable for embedded systems. Further
details of the license change are available in our <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/license-overview.html">
licence overview</a>.
To retrieve the last revision that was licensed under the RHEPL, you
need to use the <tt>last-rhepl</tt> CVS tag in your CVS checkout as
described below.</p>

<h2>The CVS source repository</h2>

<p>The anonymous CVS repository contains the latest changes to the
eCos sources and is updated as necessary by the eCos maintainers. However,
users should note that these updates have not been rigorously tested and
cannot be guaranteed to build or function correctly. It is therefore
recommended that new developers work with the v2.0 release of eCos
and RedBoot currently. The repository should be used in situations where
you need access to new features, bug fixes, or are working on a shared
contributed project.</p>

<p>The anonymous CVS repository includes as much source code as we are able to
publicize. However, there may be new architectural ports,
board ports, or areas of functionality which cannot be made available in this
way for commercial or contractual reasons.</p>

<p>The relevant host side build tools may be obtained by FTP from this site and are not provided by anonymous CVS.
Any patches or changes required to enable the use of these tools
with the latest version of eCos in the repository will be publicized.
If any updates to the eCos Configuration Tool are required, we
will put up a new binary as soon as possible. You should ensure that you use the latest version of
the Configuration Tool from the most recent net release of eCos when
working with the sources from the anonymous CVS repository.</p>

<h2>Accessing the repository</h2>

<p>Before you can access the CVS repository, you must have a CVS client (see
above) and direct TCP/IP access. If you are behind a firewall, you should
discuss access with your local systems administrator.</p>

<p>If you are using CVS v1.10 or earlier (use '<kbd>cvs -v</kbd>' to determine),
you will first need to run the following command before you can access the
repository the very first time:</p>
<kbd>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@ecos.sourceware.org:/cvs/ecos login</kbd>
<p>Any password is accepted.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you use different directory trees for the
anonymous CVS sources and for full releases of eCos. Create a new
directory for the check out, change to that directory, and type:</p>

<kbd>cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@ecos.sourceware.org:/cvs/ecos co -P ecos</kbd>

<p>This command should initiate a connection to the CVS server and check out
the latest version of eCos, including TCP/IP networking stack and SNMP. For
those who want the last version of eCos to be released under the RHEPL,
instead type:</p>

<kbd>cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@ecos.sourceware.org:/cvs/ecos co -r last-rhepl -P ecos</kbd>

<p>In the future, when you want to update your
repository to the latest version, go to the base of the repository tree and
use the command:</p>

<kbd>cvs -z3 update -d -P</kbd>

<p>or to update to the older RHEPL'd version of eCos:</p>

<kbd>cvs -z3 update -r last-rhepl -d -P</kbd>

<h2>Using the repository</h2>

<p>Once the sources have been checked out, Unix users (or Windows users using
the command line) can switch to it by setting the <tt>ECOS_REPOSITORY</tt>
environment variable to the <tt>ecos/packages</tt> subdirectory of the
checked out tree. For example:</p>

<nobr>
<kbd>ECOS_REPOSITORY=/ecoscvs/ecos/packages ; export ECOS_REPOSITORY</kbd> (for <i>sh</i>, <i>ksh</i> and <i>bash</i> users)<br>
<kbd>setenv ECOS_REPOSITORY /ecoscvs/ecos/packages</kbd> (for <i>csh</i> and <i>tcsh</i> users)
</nobr>

<p>The current set of sources in the CVS repository requires recent versions
of the host-side configuration tools for correct operation. The tools provided in
eCos releases prior to the 2.0 beta release are not suitable.
Users of the eCos Configuration Tool should select the new repository using
the Build-&gt;Repository menu item.</p>

<p>Use of a new repository with an old build tree is not recommended. Changes
may have been made to the repository CDL files that will not be present in
the working versions in your build tree.</p>

<!--<p>To update the platforms list for the "Run Tests" feature, you will need
to download and run
<A HREF="ftp://ecos.sourceware.org/pub/ecos/anoncvs/eCos-011025.reg">this
registry fragment</a>. Once downloaded, simply double click the file to install
it.</p>
-->

<h2>Other notes</h2>

<p>Anonymous CVS access to the repository is read-only. If
you would like to contribute a change, bug fix or other improvement
to eCos then you should start by discussing it on the
<a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/intouch.html">
ecos-discuss</a> mailing list. If applicable, you may wish to post
(or put up for FTP) the relevant diff or patch.</p>

<p>You can obtain e-mail notifications when changes are made to the eCos
repository. Refer to our <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/intouch.html">keeping in touch</a>
page for further details.</p>

<p>Since the anonymous CVS repository is copied from the master
repository, the author field and log entries are not accurate.
Use the ChangeLog files at the top of each package
hierarchy to obtain history on the sources in that package.</p>

<!--
<p>David Airlie of Parthus Technologies plc. has <A
HREF="../ml/ecos-discuss/2000-07/msg00070.html">announced</A> the
availability of FTP snapshots. It is possible to obtain <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.skynet.ie/cvs/" target="_top">complete snaphosts</A> and <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.skynet.ie/cvs/ecos/" target="_top">individual files</A>. This
service may be particularly useful for people unable to run CVS
directly, for example because of corporate firewalls.</p>
-->

<p>eCosCentric Limited are providing a weekly CVS
<a href="http://www.ecoscentric.com/devzone/snapshots.shtml">snapshot service</a>
for those developers who are unable to access the anonymous CVS server due to
firewall restrictions.</p>

<!--
<a href="docs-latest/">Updated documentation</a> is available, covering
changes to eCos since the last official public release. Users of the
anonymous CVS sources should refer to the updated documentation.
-->

<p>Queries and problems regarding use of the anonymous CVS service should
be directed to the <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/intouch.html">
ecos-discuss</a> mailing list. The eCos development team,
including the anonymous CVS maintainer, read this list. Please clarify
that the mail concerns an anonymous CVS problem in the subject field.</p>
